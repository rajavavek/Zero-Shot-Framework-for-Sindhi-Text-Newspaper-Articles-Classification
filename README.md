# Zero-Shot Framework for Sindhi Text Newspaper Articles Classification

This project explores zero-shot text classification for Sindhi language, which has limited computational resources. The proposed system uses the BART model and Hugging AI's transformers library to classify text into three categories: technology, sports, and entertainment. The approach achieves high accuracy without requiring labeled Sindhi data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of zero-shot learning for underrepresented languages, showcasing potential for real-world applications. The study contributes to bridging the gap in NLP research for low-resource languages like Sindhi.

The system demonstrated high accuracy across categories. 
Precision: 93.91% (Technology), 97.67% (Sports), 96.90% (Entertainment)
Recall: 98.58% (Technology), 97.02% (Sports), 94.81% (Entertainment)
F1-Score: 96.19% (Technology), 97.34% (Sports), 95.84% (Entertainment)
